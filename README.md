# Ulord Technical Features

## Instant payment
 By the master node system, it can support more than 4000 transactions per second to meet the demand of practical application better.
## Smart Contract
 Through smart contract, the benefit of content creators can be protected and the platform intermediate links can be removed to maximize the creators' benefits.
## InterPlanetary Domain Name System, IPDNS
 By constructing InterPlanetary Domain Name System, it provides users decentralized domain name analysis service. The domain name is easy to remember and convenient to use.
 UDFS(Ulord Distributed File System) is base on IPFS(InterPlanetary File System）.
 
## Multi-sidechain Technology
 According the classification of application features, Ulord takes different sidechains to load different applications and through joint mining technology ensures the sidechain safety on Ulord.
## Mixed Consensus Mechanism
 With the mixed consensus mechanism of PoW and PoS, CPU mining algorithm on PoW mechanism can effectively prevent the GPU or ASIC mining, and at the same time the user can get reward by providing storage and bandwidth resource.
## Decentralized Data Storage and Sharing Mechanism
 Based on blockchain technology database platform, it supports standard SQL language, and realizes the application of decentralized format data storage and download demand without a central server.
## Digital Content Self-purification and Self-maintenance Mechanism
 By voting mechanism and content smart check mechanism, it can calculate, analyze and filtrate the originality, sensitivity, quality of the content.
## Smart Push Based on AI algorithm
 It can integrate knowledge structure characteristics, the theme features, semantic features, etc., to realize smart push to different users according to user data and behavioral data.
## Efficient Value Sharing Mechanism
 It establishes the value transmission chain for content distribution, and by benefit distribution mechanism, encourages users to actively participate to form a good ecology featuring valuable content contribution and active spread.


### Ulord Technical Features  
#### Multi-sidechain technology  Ulord uses multi-sidechain technology to make digital assets transferred between different chains and Ulord's transaction performance, security and privacy have all been improved. Multi-sidechain technology makes Ulord easily intergrate the latest blockchain technology. Sidechain can also issue their own Token and freely combine smart contracts, micro-payments and other functions.
